      ## What is RSI Divergence?

      ### Simple Definition
      RSI divergence occurs when the price of a stock and the RSI indicator move in opposite
      directions. This often signals that the current trend may be losing strength and could reverse.

      ### How It Works

      **Bullish Divergence** (price goes down, RSI goes up)
      - Price makes a lower low
      - But RSI makes a higher low
      - Signal: Selling pressure is weakening → potential upward reversal

      **Bearish Divergence** (price goes up, RSI goes down)
      - Price makes a higher high
      - But RSI makes a lower high
      - Signal: Buying pressure is weakening → potential downward reversal

      ### Example

      Imagine a stock declining from $100 to $90 to $85:
      - First low: $90, RSI at 25
      - Second low: $85, RSI at 32

      Even though price went lower ($85 < $90), RSI went higher (32 > 25).
      This bullish divergence suggests sellers are exhausted and a bounce may be coming.

      ### How Traders Use It

      - **Entry Signal**: Look for bullish divergence at support levels to go long
      - **Exit Signal**: Bearish divergence at resistance warns to take profits or exit longs
      - **Confirmation**: Use with other indicators (MACD, volume) to confirm

      ### Important Notes

      ✅ **Strengths:**
      - Often catches trend reversals early
      - Works across timeframes

      ❌ **Limitations:**
      - Can give false signals in strong trends
      - Needs confirmation from price action
      - Doesn't tell you exactly when reversal will happen
